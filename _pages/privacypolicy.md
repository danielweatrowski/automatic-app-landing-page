# Privacy Policy
### Information Collection
No data or personal information is collected by our Yusic app. Yusic utilizes iCloud Sharing to share songs between users. To make Yusic a comfortable sharing experience, the only other data shared between users is a nickname, (optionally) a full name and (optionally) a profile image. Permission to access this data is made upon the first launch of the app and can be changed via Settings.

### Security
Yusic uses Appleâ€™s iCloud services to save all data shared between users and caches some of this information directly onto your device for quicker load times. With that, no data, including user information, is accessible to any of us at Yusic. For personal security, you have the ability to remove any other users that you wish to no longer view your songs, nickname, or profile image.

### Music
Yusic uses the Apple Music API to interact with the Apple Music catalog of songs. Yusic does not read any information from your Apple Music library.

### Contact
If you have any questions or concerns regarding your Yusic privacy, [let us know.](mailto://dweatrowski@gmail.com)
